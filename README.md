A minimalist-inspired blog design that uses firebase to host the website.
Again, design philosophy and color palette are inspired by Apple. Uses similar
input mechanics and transitions to the compound interest calculator, however utilizes
more fixed positioning of variables to place them in a neater way. San Francisco FTW
as it is one of the easiest fonts to look at, which is perfect for a minimalist blog
that primarily uses a darker color palette. Buttons have focus attributes which reveal
a starry pattern found in space. More work could have been done, like making one able
to delete a blog entry, and having proper formatting for the timestamp, or fixing navigation
bugs that come up when trying to change blog entries. I also wanted to implement better animations
when focusing on the individual blog posts, which would have helped accessibility rather
than just having a simple underline come up to highlight the blog that is being chosen.
Allowing users to upload an image could have also been extremely beneficial. I did, however,
focus on using proper naming principles to make sure my code is easily readable and follows
proper code styling conventions.
